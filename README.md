Chainanalysis, a RegTech company established in 2014, offers professional services and certification programs to FinTech professionals. RegTech is the technology and management behind regulatory processes in finance. The main components of RegTech are monitoring, reporting and compliance. RegTech firms use a type of cloud technology, known as SaaS, to aid corporations, financial institutions and regulators with business compliance. These companies solve some of the toughest issues in today's economy that are driven by technology. They use big data and machine learning technology to gather information on online transactions and distinguish outliers that have the potential of being fraud. If irregularities are found early on, costs are less of a burden to the organization (Investopedia). 


Their professional services offer blockchain analysis to solve high profile, pressing cases while creating transparency so consumers have safe access to crypto. They also offer certifications such as:  Cryptocurrency Fundamentals Certification (CCFC), Chainanalysis Reactor Certification (CRC), Chainanalysis KYT Certification (CKC), and Chainanalysis Investigation Specialist Certification (CISC). Their corporate mission is: “to build trust in blockchains to promote more financial freedom with less risk.” (Chainanalysis) The trusted blockchain analysis platform is smart to educate professionals, so they instill trust in their consumers.  


Chainanalysis has with high profile clients such as: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Square, Barclays, Korbit and Bitpay. One of the world’s leading financial institutions, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, invested in Chainanalysis in 2019 following investors: Accel, Benchmark, FundersClub, Techstars and Converge. Michael Gronanger, CEO and Co-founder of Chainanalysis made a statement following the 6- million-dollar commitment from Mitsubishi: “Our business was founded on the belief that in order for the industry to grow, all its stakeholders – governments, financial institutions, and cryptocurrency businesses – must be united in establishing ground truth for the industry. This strategic investment will strengthen our relationships with financial institutions in Asia in particular, and spearhead both our growth and the industry’s advancement in an important region” (Crowdfunder Insider). 


 Fast forward to 2021, Chainanalysis raised two-hundred-sixty-five-million dollars therefore putting their evaluation over two-billion-dollars. Over the last year the company has celebrated huge accomplishments such as: increased ARR by over 100%, doubled their clientele expanding to over 60 countries, grown to support over 100 digital assets across 10 blockchains, doubled their employees and expanded their corporate partnerships. They plan to use their funding to broaden their enterprise data offering. Co-founder Gronanger stated: “We’ll continue to invest in investigations and compliance software, but we’ll also build out new data products both for our existing customer base and new audiences” (TechCrunch). According to Owler, Chainanalysis is at the top of their niche market with Elliptic coming in second.


Overall, my recommendation to Chainanalysis is to consider building out the educational side of their business. They could easily create a college program or package to sell to universities. If Chainanalysis were to do this, they could potentially become a household name with more ease. Education is key to trust and success.
